\epigraph{``We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even this is a difficult decision. Many people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried.''}{\textit{-- Alan Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950)}}

%According to the Global Cancer Statistics 2020~\cite{sung2021global}, $\sim 19.3$ million new cancer patients and approximately 10 million deaths are reported in 2021. The report further states incidence of almost $2-3$ million non-melanoma and \textgreater 130,000 melanoma skin cancer cases annually, worldwide. Europe and North America have significantly larger numbers of melanoma skin cancer patients according to a report of the International Agency for Research on Cancer~\cite{iarc} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pie}. In the United State of America alone, there have been 93,583 new cases (52,412 male and 41,171 female) reported in the year 2021, out of which 9,320 died due to the disease~\cite{melanoma}. The leading causative factor for skin cancers is increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to depletion of the ozone layer and an additional 300,000 non-melanoma and 4,500 melanoma skin cancer cases may occur with further 10\% decrease in ozone levels~\cite{pacheco2020impact}.
